- Does CODE.CONTAINER return the smallest matching list, or the shallowest?
- Does CODE.CONTAINER push an empty list if the 1st CODE item is not a list?
- How do negative indices work in general? Do we always calculate their absolute value?
- How does CODE.EXTRACT operate when CODE item is not a list?
- What is the NTHCDR when N=0? Is the last CDR the empty list?
- Does CODE.POSITION operate using points, like CODE.EXTRACT, or indices, like CODE.MEMBER?
